For a side project I wanted to use a really lightweight library for reading
config files. Preferrably this library would not use dynamic allocations and
would give me an in-memory structure to interact with.

I never did find something to fully satisfy my needs, but I did find some
almost-there libraries that might work for you:

- minIni
  * http://www.compuphase.com/minini.htm
  * Very small, easy to include in a project and works as you expect.
    The only downside is that it constantly interacts with the OS for file IO
    to interact with the config file.

- libyaml
  * http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML
  * I didn't even bother trying to hook this up. The interface does not look
    intuitive and it's nowhere near as lightweight as minIni.

- MessagePack
  * http://msgpack.org/
  * Not really a good fit for what I want.  I want config files in human-
    readable format, but MessagePack is about converting human-readable JSON-
    like data into binary form. To use this I'd have to read the config file,
    write it to a MessagePack object in memory, then read from it.
  * https://github.com/camgunz/cmp looks really lightweight and easy to use.
  * I may end up just using this.

- Tiny Config File Parser (TCFP)
  * https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcfp/
  * Small, easy to embed. I actually was using this but struggled to have it
    actually read data from my config file as expected. Probably user error.
    It also does dynamic allocations with malloc and is in a very early
    pre-alpha state.

I may actually go back to MessagePack, but it fails miserably compared to my
ideal of a single-header drop-in library.
